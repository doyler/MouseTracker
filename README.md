# MouseTracker
Tracks how much of a particular project is owned by mice (genesis, staked, and babies).

This started out as a joke for people to counter-trade mice, but it is useful for tracking and examples in general. 

## Requirements

* Requires Python3+
* Everything in requirements.txt

## Installation

After installing Python 3, just run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Set your .env variables for ETHERSCAN_API_KEY and WEB3_URL
2. Ensure that the contract address(es) and TARGET_\* variables are correct
3. Run MouseTracker.py

## TODO

* Add support for a Discord bot (or just turn it into one)
* Clean up percentage tracking
* Allow for user input for the target project/contract
* Parse OS URL for the target?
* Better commenting and documentation
* Front-end support and tracking
* See if there is a default MAX_SUPPLY or a way to obtain it from a contract
* Anything else?
